# Agent Notes
- This repository currently has no prior agent guidance. Please keep coding style consistent with existing JavaScript/React code.
- API and frontend changes should remain lightweight and avoid introducing new frameworks beyond existing dependencies.
- Document new behaviors in README.md when adding features.
